# Work Day Scheduler
Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Motivation
A daily planner can help employees manage their time effectively.

## Problems Solved
* When user will open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* On scrolling down, user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* When the user clicks into a timeblock, they can enter an event. 
* Clicking the save button will save the text for that event in local storage.
* On refreshing the page, the saved events persist.
